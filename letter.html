<h1>💌 A Letter For You</h1>
<div class="parchment">
<p>
My dearest Khadidja,<br><br>
From the moment fate brought our paths together,
my world changed forever.
You are the light that guides my days,
the peace that calms my heart,
and the reason my soul smiles.<br><br>
Every second with you is a treasure
I will protect for eternity.<br><br>
Forever yours ❤️
<br><br>
In every version of the day, near or far, you are where my heart goes first.
You are my calm, my chaos, my favorite thought.
Loving you feels natural, like breathing.
Thank you for being my safe place, my smile, my home.
<br><br>
I love you more than words can hold 💖
<br><br>
You are the one decision I would make a thousand times over without a second thought,
You are the kind of beauty that artists dream of capturing.
<br><br>
If only you could see yourself through my eyes,
Perhaps then you would understand why I marvel at your beauty so quietly, 
Why your presence steal my words,
while leaving my heart full of things it long to say.
<br><br>
If you could see yourself through my eyes, 
you would understand why I believe in god,
because existence feels deliberate, 
crafted with intention, touched with care, 
shaped by a hand that knew exactly what was doing.
<br><br>
You are not an accident, you are grace made visible, 
a testament to divine patience and gentle design.
<br><br>
If only you could see yourself through my eyes Khadidja.
